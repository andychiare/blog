**TL;DR:** This is the third part of the series about developing a Web application based on ASP.NET Core 2.0 and React. [In the first post](http://auth0.com/blog/developing-web-apps-with-asp-dot-net-core-2-dot-0-and-react-part-1), you built a secured Web API application that provides a list of books with ASP.NET Core 2.0. [In the second post](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-web-apps-with-asp-dot-net-core-2-dot-0-and-react-part-2/), you created a *Single Page Application* (SPA) client based on React to consume this API. In this post, you will integrate the client-server system with scopes and authorization management by using Auth0 services. You can find [the final code of both the React client and the ASP.NET server in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/andychiare/react-netcore2-auth0-scopes).

## API Scopes ---Access and identity tokens

In order to enhance our client-server application, we are going to implement a more granular access control to the server's resources, so that specific users are allowed to make specific actions. In particular, we will add to our application an API to create new books and will restrict the access to this API only to specific users.

This access granularity can be obtained by using *scopes*. *Scopes* are a feature provided by [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol allowing to limit the access granted to an access token.

## Creating scopes for your APIs

As a first step you need to create scopes for your APIs. So, open the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis) and select the *Scopes* tab in the APIs section, as shown below:

![./xxx-images/api-scopes.png](./xxx-images/api-scopes.png)

Here you can define scopes for your APIs by specifying a name and a description. A scope name can be any string, but by convention it usually takes the form of `action:resource`, where `action` represents the action granted and `resource` represents the type of object upon which the action can be executed.

So, let's define the `write:books` and `read:books` scopes for our APIs:

![./xxx-images/api-scopes-defined.png](./xxx-images/api-scopes-defined.png)

Definition of scopes for APIs just declares which actions may be performed on server's resources. As a next step you need to associate scopes to users in order to grant them the ability to access server's resources.

## Installing Authorization Extension

To associate scopes with users, you need to configure permissions and roles. This may be accomplished by using the [Auth0 Authorization Extension](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/authorization-extension/v2) in [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). If you've never used this extension, you need to install it by accessing the *Extensions* section of the dashboard and by filtering the available extensions by *authorization* keyword, as shown in the following picture:

![./xxx-images/authorization-extension.png](./xxx-images/authorization-extension.png)

Then click the *Auth0 Autorization* box to start the installation process. You will be prompted to choose the storage where you would like to store your data. For this simple application we will choose the default choice, *Webtask Storage*:

![./xxx-images/auth0-authorization-install.png](./xxx-images/auth0-authorization-install.png)



Once the extension is installed, you will see it listed in the *Installed Extensions* tab.



## Configuring permissions and roles

Now that you have installed the *Authorization Extension*, you can use it to configure permissions and roles. To be clear, let's define what they are:

- *Permissions* are actions that a users can do, such as reading a list of books or adding a new book to the list.

- *Roles* are collections of permissions. For example, we can define a role for administrators that have the permissions to read the list of books and to add a new book to the list.


So, you can select the *Permissions* section in *Authorization Extension* and click the *Create Permission* button. You will be prompted to provide data defining the permission, as shown below:

![./xxx-images/create-permission.png](./xxx-images/create-permission.png)

Here you will provide the name of the permission, a description and the client application the permission should be bound to.

> **Note**: Ensure that the name of a permission is exactly the same as the corresponding scope.

In our case, the resulting permissions configuration is as follows:

![./xxx-images/permissions.png](./xxx-images/permissions.png)

Now let's go and define two roles for our application: *Admin*, having both permissions you've just created, and *User*, having just the `read:books` permission. By selecting *Roles* section and then clicking *Creating Role* button, you are asked to provide a few information about the role you want to create, as you can see in the following picture:

![./xxx-images/create-role.png](./xxx-images/create-role.png)

Use this form to create both roles. The final result should be as follows:

![./xxx-images/roles.png](./xxx-images/roles.png)



## Adding roles to users

Next, you will need to associate roles to users. Actually, in *Users* section of the *Authorization Extension* you will find all the users already created in your *Auth0* platform. Here you can assign roles to each user by selecting him, using the *Roles* tab and clicking the *Add role to user* button. Now you can check the roles you want to assign the user, as shown by the following picture:

![./xxx-images/roles-to-user.png](./xxx-images/roles-to-user.png)



## Publishing permission rule

As a final step of *Authorization Extension* configuration, you need to click your domain drop-down menu in the upper right corner and select the *Configuration* item:

![./xxx-images/auth-extension-configuration.png](./xxx-images/auth-extension-configuration.png)

In the page that appears, make sure that *Permissions* are enabled and click *Publish Rule* button:

![./xxx-images/auth-extension-rule-publish.png](./xxx-images/auth-extension-rule-publish.png)

This operation creates a rule for your tenant that will be executed after each user login. In *Auth0* platform, a [rule](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/) is a JavaScript function that is executed when the user is authenticated. The newly created rule will add user's permissions to the user's profile. You can check the rule's code by using the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules).

## Validating the token scopes

The last step in this configuration process is to create a new rule which ensures that scopes contained in an *access token* is valid accordingly to the user's permission. It means that when a user is authenticated, you need to add only the user's permissions to his *access token*. To add this rule, go to [Rules](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules) section in the *Auth0* dashboard, click the *Create rule* button and select the *Empty rule* template. Now, give a name to the rule and put the following code into the code window:

```javascript
function (user, context, callback) {
  if (context.clientName !== 'Bookstore client') {
    return callback(null, user, context);
  }
  
  var permissions = user.permissions || [];
  var requestedScopes = context.request.body.scope || context.request.query.scope;
  var filteredScopes = requestedScopes.split(' ').filter( function(x) {
    return x.indexOf(':') < 0;
  });
  Array.prototype.push.apply(filteredScopes, permissions);
  context.accessToken.scope = filteredScopes.join(' ');

  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

The first line of the JavaScript function's body checks if the current client is our *Bookstore client*. If not, the rule is not executed. Otherwise, only the user's permissions are assigned to the access token's `scope` property. Once you have put this code, click the *Save* button.

> **Note**: Keep in mind that the rules are executed in the order they are displayed in the *Rules* section.



## Adding scope management to .NET API

After this configuration process on the [Auth0](https://manage.auth0.com/) platform side, you need to change the code of the ASP.NET Core 2 Web API application built in [part 1](http://auth0.com/blog/developing-web-apps-with-asp-dot-net-core-2-dot-0-and-react-part-1) of this series. As a first step, you need to implement a way to add an access control to the Web API and to check if a request has the rights to access the Web API. You can apply the [Policy-based Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies) provided by ASP.NET Core.

Following this approach you need to define an *Authorization requirement* and an *Authorization handler*. The former is a collection of data containing the current user's rights. The latter evaluates the *Authorization requirement* to determine if access is allowed.

Let's define the *Authorization requirement* as follows:

```c#
public class HasScopeRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement
{
	public string Issuer { get; }
	public string Scope { get; }

	public HasScopeRequirement(string scope, string issuer)
	{
		Scope = scope ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(scope));
		Issuer = issuer ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(issuer));
	}
}
```

The `HasScopeRequirement`class inherits from `IAuthorizationRequirement`and its constructor simply assigns the `scope` and the `issuer` passed as parameters to its public properties `Scope` and `Issuer`.

The *Authorization handler* will be implemented as shown by the following code:

```c#
public class HasScopeHandler : AuthorizationHandler<HasScopeRequirement>
{
	protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, 			HasScopeRequirement requirement)
	{
		if (!context.User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == "scope" && c.Issuer == requirement.Issuer))
			return Task.CompletedTask;

		var scopes = context.User
			.FindFirst(c => c.Type == "scope" && c.Issuer == requirement.Issuer)
			.Value.Split(' ');

		if (scopes.Any(s => s == requirement.Scope))
                context.Succeed(requirement);

		return Task.CompletedTask;
	}
}
```

The class `HasScopeHandler` inherits from `AuthorizationHandler`. It overrides the `HandleRequirementAsync()` method by taking the current `context` and authorization `requirement` as parameters.

If the current user principal hasn't a `scope` claim issued by the trusted `Issuer` defined in the authorization requirement, the authorization is denied. Otherwise, the user's scopes are compared with the requirement's scope. Only if al least one user's scope matches the requirement's scope, the authorization is granted.

Now, you need to change the `ConfigurationServices()` method in `Startup` class in order to make available the newly created Authorization requirement and handler, as in the following:

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddAuthentication(options =>
	{
		options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
		options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;

	}).AddJwtBearer(options =>
	{
		options.Authority = Configuration["Auth0:Authority"];
		options.Audience = Configuration["Auth0:Audience"];
	});

	services.AddAuthorization(options =>
	{
		options.AddPolicy("read:books", policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new 							HasScopeRequirement("read:books", Configuration["Auth0:Authority"])));
	});

	services.AddSingleton<IAuthorizationHandler, HasScopeHandler>();
	services.AddMvc();
}
```

The differences from the previous version of the method concern the addition of the new policy through `services.AddAuthorization()` method and the registration of `HasScopeHandler` as a singleton through `AddSingleton()`.

The final step to setup scope management at the API side is to pass the `read:books` scope to the `Authorize` attribute in order to enable the access control for the Web API:

```c#
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class BooksController : Controller
{
	[HttpGet, Authorize("read:books")]
	public IEnumerable<Book> Get()
	{
		var resultBookList = new Book[] { ... };

		return resultBookList;
	}
}
```



## Testing authorization policy for read permission

Now you can test Web API access control by simply running the *Single Page Application* created in [part 2](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-web-apps-with-asp-dot-net-core-2-dot-0-and-react-part-2/) of this series. If you access the application by using a user with *User* or *Admin* role, you will be able to get the list of books provided by the Web API. Otherwise, you will not be able to get the list and will get a page like the following:

![./xxx-images/no-booklist-on-client.png](./xxx-images/no-booklist-on-client.png)

If you look at the *Developer tools* console or some other similar tool in your browser, you will find something like this:

![./xxx-image/forbidden-dev-tools.png](./xxx-images/forbidden-dev-tools.png)

As expected, the Web API refused to provide you the requested data since you have not the required permissions.

You could make the user experience a bit more fluent by managing the `403` HTTP status code on the client side. For example, you could change the `ComponentDidMount` method for the `Home` React component as follows:

```javascript
  componentDidMount() {
    const accessToken = this.props.auth.getAccessToken();
    
    fetch("/api/books", {headers: new Headers({
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    })})
        .then(response => {
          if (response.ok) {
            return response.json()
          }
          if (response.status === 403) {
            alert("You are not authorized!")
          }          
        })
        .then(books => this.setState({bookList: books || []}))
        .catch(error => console.log(error))
  }
```

In this case, if the status code returned by the server is `403`, the application will simply show an alert saying that the user is not authorized to access that page.

## Managing write permissions in APIs

So far we have only managed the `read:books` permission. Now we are going to change the ASP.NET Core 2 Web API application to support `write:books` permission.

As a first step, let's add the authorization policy in `Startup` class. You simply need to change the lambda function passed to the  `AddAuthorization()` method as in the following:

```c#
	services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
    	options.AddPolicy("read:books", policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new
    		HasScopeRequirement("read:books", Configuration["Auth0:Authority"])));
		options.AddPolicy("write:books", policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new 
			HasScopeRequirement("write:books", Configuration["Auth0:Authority"])));
	});
```

Then, let's change the `BooksController` class in order to allow adding new books to the existing list.

First of all, you need to transform the current array of books into a static list, as shown below:

```c#
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class BooksController : Controller
{
	private static List<Book> bookList = new List<Book>() {
    	new Book { Author = "Ray Bradbury", Title = "Fahrenheit 451", AgeRestriction = false },
        new Book { Author = "Gabriel García Márquez", Title = "One Hundred years of Solitude",
        	AgeRestriction = false },
		new Book { Author = "George Orwell", Title = "1984", AgeRestriction = false },
		new Book { Author = "Anais Nin", Title = "Delta of Venus", AgeRestriction = true }
	};

	[HttpGet, Authorize("read:books")]
    public IEnumerable<Book> Get()
    {
    	return bookList;
	}

	...
}
```

This is necessary because we need to keep the same list among the various requests and get any changes to it. Of course, in a real world scenario this data should be stored in a database.

Now you can add a new API to add a book to the current book list:

```c#
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class BooksController : Controller
{
	...
	
	[HttpPost, Authorize("write:books")]
    public void Post([FromBody] Book book)
    {
		bookList.Add(book);
	}

	...
}

```

As you can see, the new API simply adds to the list of books the book representation received from the body of the HTTP POST request. The important thing is that the API has been marked with the `Authorize` attribute by specifying that the `write:books` permission is required.



## Allowing to add books from React client

On the React client side, let's go and implement the addition of books.

First, you add in the home page a link that will open a page allowing to submit a new book. This can be done by starting with a small change in the JSX code of the `Home` component, as shown below:

```javascript
class Home extends React.Component {
  ...
  
  render() {
	...
    return  <div>
              <Link to="/bookForm">Add a book</Link>
              <ul>
                {bookList}
              </ul>
            </div>;
  }
}
```

This simple addition makes the home page looking as follows:

![./xxx-images/home-page-with-link.png](./xxx-images/home-page-with-link.png)

Then you need to define the route used in the `Link` component by creating it in the `App` component. The new route definition will be as follows:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  ...
  
  render() {
	let logoutButton =  this.createLogoutButton();
	
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
		  {logoutButton}
          <h1 className="App-title">My Bookstore</h1>
        </header>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" render={() => this.renderHome()}/>
          <Route path="/startSession" render={({history}) => this.startSession(history)}/>
          <Route path="/bookForm" render={({history}) => <BookForm history={history} auth={this.authService}/>}/>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

The `/bookForm` route is mapped to the `BookForm` component along with two props representing the browser history and the authentication service implemented in `AuthService` module.

Let's implement the `BookForm` component as shown in the following:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './BookForm.css'

class BookForm extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      author: "",
      title: ""
    };
  }

  handleAuthorChange(e) {
    this.setState({author: e.target.value});
  }

  handleTitleChange(e) {
    this.setState({title: e.target.value});
  }

  render() {
    return <div className="formContainer">
    <form onSubmit={(e) => this.handleFormSubmit(e)}>
        <div className="row">
            <label className="col-50" htmlFor="author">Author</label>
      		<input type="text" name="author" value={this.state.author} 
      			onChange={(e)=> this.handleAuthorChange(e)}/>
        </div>
        <div className="row">
            <label className="col-50" htmlFor="title">Title</label>
      		<input type="text" name="title" value={this.state.title} 
      			onChange={(e)=> this.handleTitleChange(e)}/>
        </div>
        <div className="row">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit book"/>
        </div>
    </form>
    </div>;
  }

  handleFormSubmit(e) {
	//TO BE IMPLEMENTED
  }
}

export default BookForm;

```

The markup generated by the `render()` method of the component defines a classical form with two text box and a submit button. Its appearance is as shown by the following picture:

![./xxx-images/book-form.png](./xxx-images/book-form.png)

The styles of the form are defined in the `BookForm.css` file imported by the component.

Looking at the component's code, you can find that the constructor initializes the state of the component. It is defined as an object with empty string for the author and the title of a book. You can also find two methods, `handleAuthorChange()` and `handleTitleChange()`, used to apply changes from the form elements to the component's state. The `handleFormSubmit()` method, bound to the `onSubmit` event of the form, is not actually implemented in the code above. You can implement it as follows:

```javascript
  handleFormSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const accessToken = this.props.auth.getAccessToken();

    fetch("/api/books", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(this.state),
      headers: new Headers({
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    })
    }).then((response) => {
      if (response.ok) {
        this.props.history.push("/");
      } else {
        alert(response.statusText);
      }
    });
  }
```

As you can see, the first line of the method prevents the default behaviour of form submission. This is needed to avoid the standard page reloading performed by the browser. Then you get the access token by using the `getAccessToken()` method provided by `AuthService` module. Finally, you submit the current component state to the server by using `fetch()`. When a response is received from the server, if its status code is successful, the current route is changed with the root, that is you move back to the `Home` component. Otherwise the message returned by the server is shown in an alert.



## Disabling book addition for not authorized users

The implementation we have made so far works fine. If you access the application by using an admin user, you will be able to add a new book by clicking the *Add a book* link, filling the form and submitting it to the server. On the other hand, if you access the application by using a simple user, that is a non admin user, you will be able to click the *Add a button* link and fill the book form, but when you will try to submit the form's data to the server you will receive a `403` HTTP status code.

Even if this behaviour is functionally correct, letting the user to access the book form when he is not authorized to send data to the server is very annoying. You should make sure that only admin users access the book form. In other words, only admin users should see the *Add a button* link.

You can obtain this result by making a few changes to the React application.

The first thing you need to do is getting the scopes returned by the authorization server and store them into the session data. That's mean to add the following line to the `setSession()` method of the `AuthService` class:

```javascript
 setSession(authResult) {
    ...
    localStorage.setItem('scopes', JSON.stringify(authResult.scope || ""));
  }
```

As you can see, you can find the user's scope in the `authResult` object returned by the server after the authentication. In particular, the `scope` property will be persisted as a string with all the other session info.

Now you can add the `hasScopes()` method to the `AuthService` class:

```javascript
export default class AuthService {
  ...
  
  hasScopes(scopes) {
    const grantedScopes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('scopes')).split(' ');
    return scopes.every(scope => grantedScopes.includes(scope));
  }
}
```

This method takes an array of strings representing scopes and returns a boolean value saying if the passed scopes are included in the scopes granted to the user (`true`) or not (`false`).

You will use the `hasScopes()` method inside the `render()` method of the `Home` component as shown by the following snippet of code:

```javascript
class Home extends React.Component {
  ...
  render() {
    let bookList = this.state.bookList.map((book) => 
                            <li><i>{book.author}</i> - <h3>{book.title}</h3></li>);
    let addBookButton = this.props.auth.hasScopes(["write:books"])? 
        <Link to="/bookForm">Add a book</Link> 
    	: null;

    return  <div>
              {addBookButton}
              <ul>
                {bookList}
              </ul>
            </div>;
  }
}
```

As you can see, the `addBookButton` variable will contain the `<Link>` element when the user has the `write:books` permission. Otherwise its value will be `null`. This conditional rendering of the *Add a book* link solves our issue.



## Summary

In this third part of the series, you made a few settings on the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) in order to define and manage scopes and roles for users. Then you changed [the Web API application implemented in the first part](http://auth0.com/blog/developing-web-apps-with-asp-dot-net-core-2-dot-0-and-react-part-1) and the [React-based client built in the second part](http://auth0.com/blog/developing-web-apps-with-asp-dot-net-core-2-dot-0-and-react-part-1) of the series in order to support user's permission previously defined.

You can find the final code and download it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andychiare/react-netcore2-auth0-scopes).
